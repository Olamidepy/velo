# npm Audit Vulnerability Triage

## Overview

Per issue #53, this document contains the triage analysis of 10 npm audit vulnerabilities found in the `Nullifier-Systems/velo` monorepo as of 2026-07-17.

---

## Applied Fixes

| Package | Old Version | New Version | Type | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------|------|--------|
| `fast-uri` | 2.4.0 | 2.4.1 | Patch (safe, via `npm audit fix`) | ⚠️ Still within vulnerable range (≤3.1.1) — vulnerability count unchanged |

**Note:** `fast-uri@2.4.1` remains within the vulnerable range (≤3.1.1). A full fix requires upgrading to `fast-uri@>=3.2.0`, which requires the `fastify` ecosystem to upgrade to v5 (breaking change).

The vulnerability count remained at **10** after `npm audit fix` because the patch did not exit the vulnerable range.

## Remaining Vulnerabilities — Risk Assessment

### Runtime Dependencies (Real Risk)

These packages are used in production and represent genuine risk:

| Package | Severity | GHSA ID | Workspace | Description | Fix Available |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **fastify** | High | `GHSA-mrq3-vjjr-p77c` `GHSA-jx2c-rxcm-jvmq` `GHSA-444r-cwp2-x5xf` | `@velo/api`, `@velo/backend` | DoS via unbounded memory allocation, body validation bypass via tab character, protocol/host spoofing | `fastify@5.x` (breaking) |
| **fast-uri** | High | `GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6` `GHSA-v39h-62p7-jpjc` | (fastify transitive dep) | Path traversal via percent-encoded dot segments, host confusion via percent-encoded delimiters | `>=3.2.0` (requires fastify v5) |
| **@fastify/ajv-compiler** | High | _(via fast-uri)_ | (fastify transitive dep) | Affected by `fast-uri` vulnerability | Requires fastify v5 |
| **fast-json-stringify** | High | _(via fast-uri)_ | (fastify transitive dep) | Affected by `fast-uri` vulnerability | Requires fastify v5 |
| **@fastify/fast-json-stringify-compiler** | High | _(via fast-json-stringify)_ | (fastify transitive dep) | Affected by `fast-json-stringify` vulnerability | Requires fastify v5 |

### Development-Only Dependencies (Low Production Risk)

These packages are only used during development, building, and testing. They are **not exposed** in production environments:

| Package | Severity | GHSA ID | Workspace | Description | Risk Rationale |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **vitest** | Critical | `GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp` | `@velo/api`, `@velo/relayer` | Arbitrary file read/execution via Vitest UI server | **Low** — Vitest UI server not used; only run in CI/development |
| **vite** | High | `GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9` `GHSA-v6wh-96g9-6wx3` `GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff` | `@velo/frontend` | Path traversal in optimized deps, NTLMv2 hash disclosure, `server.fs.deny` bypass | **Low** — Dev/build tool only, not exposed in production |
| **esbuild** | Moderate | `GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99` | (vite/vitest transitive dep) | Enables websites to send requests to dev server | **Low** — Build-time only |
| **vite-node** | Moderate | _(via vite)_ | (vitest transitive dep) | Affected by `vite` vulnerability | **Low** — Dev-only |
| **@vitest/mocker** | Moderate | _(via vite)_ | (vitest transitive dep) | Affected by `vite` vulnerability | **Low** — Dev-only |

## Breaking Changes Requiring Follow-Up

The following fixes require **major version upgrades** and cannot be safely auto-fixed with `npm audit fix`:

### 1. Fastify v4 → v5 Migration

**Affected workspaces:** `@velo/api`, `@velo/backend`
**Vulnerabilities resolved:** 5 (all high-severity runtime vulns)
**Scope:**
- Update `fastify` from `^4.28.0` to `^5.x` in `apps/api/package.json` and `mobile/backend/package.json`
- Update `@fastify/cors` from `^9.0.1` to compatible version
- Update `@fastify/rate-limit` from `^9.1.0` to compatible version
- Audit all route registration and hook APIs for v5 breaking changes
- See: [Fastify V5 Migration Guide](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Migration-Guide-V5.md)

### 2. Vite v5 → v6/v8 + Vitest v2 → v3 Migration

**Affected workspaces:** `@velo/frontend` (vite), `@velo/api` + `@velo/relayer` (vitest)
**Vulnerabilities resolved:** 5 (1 critical, 3 high, 2 moderate — but all dev-only)
**Scope:**
- Update `vite` from `^5.4.0` to `^6.x` (or `^8.x`) in `mobile/frontend/package.json`
- Update `@vitejs/plugin-react` to compatible version
- Update `vitest` from `^2.0.5` to `^3.x` in `apps/api/package.json` and `apps/relayer/package.json`
- Check Vite migration guides for breaking changes

---

## Summary

- **1 safe fix applied** — `fast-uri` 2.4.0 → 2.4.1 (patch update, still within vulnerable range)
- **Vulnerability count unchanged** at 10 after the patch (patch did not exit the vulnerable version range)
- **5 runtime vulnerabilities** remain in the `fastify` ecosystem — these require a Fastify v4→v5 migration
- **5 dev-only vulnerabilities** remain in `vite`/`vitest` — low production risk, require a Vite + Vitest major version upgrade
- All **23 tests pass** after the safe fix
