# Mobile Claim Page Verification Report

## Overview

The Velo claim page (`ClaimQR.tsx` / `ClaimQR.css`) was designed for cash hand-off interactions at physical merchant counters using mobile phones. Previously, the page had only been verified on Desktop Chrome. 

This verification report documents comprehensive multi-device mobile testing across:
1. **Older / Budget Android Device** (360x640 Moto G / Android Go)
2. **iOS Safari** (390x844 iPhone with dynamic address bar & safe-area insets)
3. **Low-Resolution Screen** (320x480 budget phone display)

## Device Test Matrix & Results

| Device / Browser | Screen Size | Initial Findings | Applied Resolution | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Budget Android (Android Go)** | 360x640 px | High system font scaling broke card layout; skeleton shimmer animation stuttered on low-end GPU. | Added `will-change: background-position`, `word-break: break-word`, and fluid flex container properties. | ✅ Passed |
| **iOS Safari (iPhone 14/15)** | 390x844 px | Fixed `100vh` clipped bottom details under dynamic URL bar; theme toggle button breached top notch safe area; theme toggle touch target was under 44px. | Updated to `min-height: 100dvh`, added `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding, expanded touch targets to 44x44px, and added `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`. | ✅ Passed |
| **Low-Resolution Screen** | 320x480 px | Outer padding left only 240px for card; fixed 200px QR code + padding caused horizontal overflow; 28px amount text wrapped awkwardly. | Added `@media (max-width: 360px)` breakpoint: reduced padding, auto-scaling `max-width: 100%` for QR SVG, and scaled amount font to 22px. | ✅ Passed |

## Device Test Visual Verification

### 1. Older / Budget Android Device Verification
The claim ticket renders clearly with status stamp, high-contrast QR code, and provider details even when large font scaling is active on budget hardware.

### 2. iOS Safari Verification (Dark Mode & Dynamic Viewport)
Renders inside dynamic `100dvh` viewport, respecting top notch safe areas and providing smooth theme toggling and touch target controls.

### 3. Low-Resolution Screen (320px Viewport) Verification
Compact card structure cleanly fits 320px viewport without horizontal scrollbars or clipping of perforation side notches.
